## 📄 Description – Exercise Statement

- Create and populate a `List<Integer>` with several integer values

- Create a second `List<Integer>`

- Use a `ListIterator` to read the elements of the first list **in reverse order**

- Insert each element into the second list, resulting in a reversed version of the original

This exercise focuses on the use of the `ListIterator` interface for **bidirectional iteration**, manipulation of `List` collections, and safe element traversal in Java. It reinforces understanding of **collection APIs**, especially when reverse-order access is required.
