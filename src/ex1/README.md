## 📄 Description – Exercise Statement

- Create a class `Month` with the following attribute:
    - `name`: stores the name of a month of the year

- Add 11 `Month` objects to an `ArrayList`, **excluding** the one whose name is `"August"`

- Insert `"August"` in the correct chronological position, and verify that the `ArrayList` maintains the correct order after the insertion

- Convert the `ArrayList` into a `HashSet` to ensure that no duplicate elements are allowed

- Traverse the collection using:
    - A standard `for` loop (or `for-each`)
    - An `Iterator` object

This exercise focuses on **object creation**, **list manipulation**, **collection conversion**, and **ensuring uniqueness using sets**. It also emphasizes the correct implementation of `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods for use in hash-based collections.
